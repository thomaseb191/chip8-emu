# chip8-emu
This is my implementation of a Chip-8 instruction processor. It is a foray into the world of emulation so there is much that can be improved.
## Goals
My main goal for this project was to begin to form an understanding for how emulators generally functioned. Implementing the Chip-8 instruction set seemed like the best way to get started. Additionally, I wanted to learn the basics of a simple graphics library, and SDL seemed to be the perfect fit for that. Finally, I hope for this project to be a testing ground for creating features that go beyond the scope of the instruction set, including but not limited to:
- Save states
- Pausing and resuming execution
- Register and memory viewing
- Register and memory manipulation
## Current State
In it's current state, my Chip-8 emulator is mostly functional. All instructions have been implemented, however extensive testing still needs to be done to ensure that they were implemented properly.
